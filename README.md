# SteamFM
Projeto LP3 - 4G12 - 2015
This was a project for one of ours fourth semester class in which we had to consume an API of our choice and build an web application based on it.

We choose two APIs, Steam and LastFM, our ideia was to give music recomendations to the user based on his/hers games on Steam.But nothing too complicated, just database relation between a game's tag and a music.

We also had to use Java RMI in any part of the project, so we choosed to use it to read the database. This way we have an application that works as a Server and another that works as a Client, the Client also exposes an WebInterface to the user.
