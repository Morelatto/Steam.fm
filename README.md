SteamFM
Projeto LP3 - 4G12 - 2015

SteamFM was a college project for the _Programming Languages 3_ class which we had to consume any API of our choice and build a web application around it using Java EE technologies such as JPA, RMI and EJB.

We chose two APIs, Steam and LastFM, our ideia was to give song recomendations to the user based on his/hers games on Steam.But nothing too complicated, just database relation between a game's tag and a song.

We also had to use Java RMI in any part of the project, so we chosed to use it to read the database. This way we have an application that works as a Server and another that works as a Client, the Client also exposes an WebInterface to the user.
